a long journey of problems
how and how to solve them

had to stop all downloads and background applications on desktop while attempting to upload
had to restart computer and disable all staart up apllications 
moved the project and all files assocated to my m.2 in hopes to avoid problems with the memory issues 
after that had to go back to a pervois version of my project to get most of the stuff to work again and after all that finished
to this point,90% problem solveing something ive never had happen before and 10% uplaoding 

then i had weird code change error pop up on unity to find that somethings didnt translate properly it seems? 
and kept have git hub give me a HTTP ERROR 400 when trying to update or load repsoritory to website
